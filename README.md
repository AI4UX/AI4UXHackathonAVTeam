# AI4UX (A.V.Team)
A.V.Team would love to present you with the AI that predicts your mobile application's Google Store User Rating based on your application's user interface! Human judgments are biased and flawed. When forecasting your application's user rating to your application, emotions will step into the way. Most app makers will reserve to releasing the application to the market and hope for the best. However, we are introducing a data-driven, non-bias, non-emotional AI tools that rate your app.
Here's how you can rate your app.
1. Visit this site: www.TESTING.com.
2. Screenshot a page of your mobile application.
3. Upload the screenshot to our website.
4. Click on "Predict."
5. Our AI will present the forecasted user rating result on the site.
6. You can test out another screenshot by clicking "Try Again."
Our AI utilizes data from >30,000 Google Store mobile applications, and all the applications have >100,000 downloads. These are applications includes Facebook, Slack, Livongo. We feed our model with the screenshots of the application with the final Google Store user rating. Our model will process each image, analyze the app's UI, and receive its user rating.
In the future, we can implement more data points and higher resolution images into our AI model. With more engineering resources, we can also expand the AI model algorithm to recognize the color, readability of text, and even the app's contents to be apart of our complete evaluation. With a more complex database, we can even predict other UX KPI like sessions length, session interval, session depth, average screens per visit, etc. Our AI can provide a data-driven, non-bias, and non-emotional evaluation of the app.
